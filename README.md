*** NOTES AND INSIGHTS ***

- This is just a demo of my skillsets on Deploying a simple "ecommerce app" with Angular2+, typescript, Node.js Express, Mongodb and docker. I felt like a whole IT department doing this project (LOL). Front-end, backend, DevOps. 

- The design patterns and security implementations were not intigrated due to this just being a demo. Do not use for live production. 

- This is my first time with this stack using Angular2+, typescript, mongodb, node-express and docker. P.S. I had to learn the whole stack from scratch within 2 weeks while in Christmas and New Year holliday be gentle. :)
